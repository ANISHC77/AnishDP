    <h3>Name: Anish Choudhury</h3>
    <h3>Date: 9-Jan-2022</h3>
    <h3>I received assistance from: Brendon, Ethan, Shreyas, Mrs. Jang</h3>
    <h3>I assisted: NO ONE</h3>
    <h2>WEEK ONE</h2>
    <h3><u>Role: Software Development Manager</u></h3>
    <p>What is a Software Development Manager?</p>
    <p>Well, a Software Development Manager is a person that solves real-world issues through the designing of computer programs.</p>
    <p>My personal goal for this week is to create the programs needed by my team for our upcoming project.</p>
    <p>This job may be difficult for me because I have little knowledge of swift which is a challenge for me.</p>
    <p>I can easily overcome this challenge with asking questions to Mrs.Jang and my partners in this project.</p>
    <h3><u>Interpersonal Challenges</u></h3>
    <p>There has only been one challenge so far and that challenge is that I have had an absence in the last class.</p>
    <p>This issue has now been resolved and now I am fully caught up with our project.</p>
    <p>If this issue comes up again, me and the 2 other attendive team members will create a list of things the absent team member was gone for.</p>
    <p>If any outstanding issue comes up again, I will be sure to update this journal as it holds what we do from a day to day basis.</p>
    <h3><u>Scheduling Challenges</u></h3>
    <p>This is a major issue as we have not created a schedule as of yet.</p>
    <p>We expect to resolve this matter as a matter of 2-3 classes as it is an easy fix.</p>
    <p>We will try to make this schedule fit to eachother's personal schedules as best as we can.</p>
    <p>There are no other problems regarding the Schedule. Any future scheduling problems, we will face that path once we get to it.</p>
    <h3><u>Technical Challenges</u></h3>
    <p>There are a few major technical issues we may encounter</p>
    <p>None of us fully understand Swift. While this may be an issue now, it won't be forever.</p>
    <p>None of us know how to use Firefox which is a browser required by the programming software. This also is a temporary issue.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we do not know of any future problems. This could come back and hurt us.</p>
