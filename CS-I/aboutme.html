    <h1>WHATS UP!</h1>
    <h2>I am in NHS(National Honor Society). Robotics is one of my passions. I dream of being an aerospace engineer so computer science and engineering are exciting hobbies for me. Some of my other hobbies include playing tennis and hanging out with my friends. During the Summer, I would wake up as early as 6 a.m. to practice on the courts. I would also call my friends and make plans with them any chance I could. Such as, videogames, going to restuarants with them, and playing 4 square.</h2>
    <h2>My family consists of 4 people, my mom, my dad, and my sister, Anmol. My sister is tennis legend. She is currently in college at UTD and in her 3rd and final year studying to become a Physician Assisstant. Me and my sister like to binge watch shows together when she has the time. My mom is an amazing cook and my dad is great at being an awesome parent. My dad is devotee to Hinduism and sings mantras everyday. He taught me some aswell. </h2>

    <h2>I really enjoy listening to music. WOLF, by Tyler the Creator, is by far my favorite album. Some other albums I enjoy are Late Registration by Kanye West and To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar.</h2>
