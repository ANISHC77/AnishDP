    <h1>CS-I Journal J1017: Binary Adders</h1>
    <p>Name: Anish Choudhury</p>
    <p>Date: 24-Oct-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mrs. Jang</p>
    <p>I assisted: NO ONE</p>

    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <p>1.1: The AND GATE</p>
    <p>1.2: The XOR GATE</p>

    <h2><u>Section 2</u></h2>
    <p>2.1: The top row is a XOR gate and the bottom row is a NOT XOR gate.</p>
    <p>2.2: This is true because the out puts of the sum says so.</p>

    <h2><u>Section 3</u></h2>
    <p>3.1: Because it does not need a carry in.</p>
    <p>3.2: No, because it has to go through all of the binary adders before getting the sum.</p>
    <p>3.3: If C15 is high, it is probable that the answer is wrong.</p>

    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned that computers use binary adders to do simple operations.</p>

    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I got to the ripple carry adder part.</p>

    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by having this explained by a teacher.</p>

    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that computers use binary adders to do simple operations.</p>
