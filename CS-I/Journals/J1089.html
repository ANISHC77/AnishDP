    <h1>CS-I Journal J1089: Hello World</h1>
    <p>Name: Anish Choudhury</p>
    <p>Date: 20-Jan-2023</p>
    
    <p>I received assistance from: Mrs. Jang</p>
    <p>I assisted: NO ONE</p>
    
    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <p>1.1: I think that Hello World is taught to students first to teach the students the format of the code. For example, python uses parenthesis meanwhile java uses brackets.</p>
    <p>1.2: It might be different with the format. Going back to my last answer, python uses parenthesis meanwhile java uses brackets.</p>
    
    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned that learning Hello World also teaches you the format of different languages.</p>
    
    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I got to the Assembly language in the mission.</p>
    
    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by studying the wiki some more.</p>

    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that formats of different languages are vital to it working properly.</p>
