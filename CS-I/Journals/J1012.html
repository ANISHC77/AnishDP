    <h1>CS-I Journal J1012: Alternative Base Addition</h1>
    <p>Name: Anish Choudhury</p>
    <p>Date: 9-Sep-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mrs. Jang</p>
    <p>I assisted: NO ONE</p>

    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p>For example, 12 + 15. It becomes 27 because of combining the last and first digits together.</p>

    <h2><u>Section 2</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>For Octal adding, you have to ignore the numbers that have 8 and 9 because they are not in the octal system.</p>

    <h2><u>Section 3</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing additon with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p>For hexadecimal adding, the letters, ABCDEF, are between 9 and 10.</p>

    <h2><u>Section 4</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>For Binary adding, 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 10, 1 + 1 + 1 = 1, 0 + 0  = 0</p>

    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned how to add with alternative bases.</p>

    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I got to binary and hexadecimal.</p>

    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by doing hexadecimal and binary problems in class.</p>

    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that computers use so many complex languages and understand it easily.</p>
