    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <h3>1.1: Yes because you can still modify the parameters to repeat something to however many times you want.</h3>
    <h3>1.2: No because you cannot repeat something however many times you want without adding a conditional or changing the condition.</h3>
    
    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <h3>I learned how to use repeat-while loops in Swift.</h3>
    
    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <h3>I encountered challlenges when understanding the assembly language in the wiki.</h3>
    
    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <h3>This experience could be improved by studying the wiki some more.</h3>
    
    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <h3>I now realize that lots of computers follow repeat-while loops as they are easier to use than regular while loops.</h3>
