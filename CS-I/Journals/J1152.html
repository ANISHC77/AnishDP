    <p>I assisted: NO ONE</p>
    
    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <p>1.1: To see whether or not if the boolean evaluates to false or true. The while loop doing its function is determined on that information.</p>
    <p>1.2: They are similar as they both jump back to the start. What is different is that the condition has no condition statements.</p>
    <p>1.3: To see if the condition still meets the boolean and whether to repeat the loop or not.</p>
    
    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned how to use while loops in Swift.</p>
    
    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when understanding the graphs in the wiki.</p>
    
    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by studying the wiki some more.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that lots of computers follow while loops.</p>
