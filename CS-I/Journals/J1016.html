    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What happens to H?</h3>
    <p>The H becomes an L.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Does the color of the wire change?</h3>
    <p>Yes, the color becomes gray.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: How is the output impacted?</h3>
    <p>The output also becomes an L</p>

    <h2><u>Section 2</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What happens to H?</h3>
    <p>The H becomes an L.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Does the color of the wire change?</h3>
    <p>Yes, one side becomes green meanwhile the other side becomes gray.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: How is the output impacted?</h3>
    <p>The output becomes an H.</p>

    <h2><u>Section 3</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What happens to the top L?</h3>
    <p>The top L becomes an H and becomes green.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What happens to the output?</h3>
    <p>The output stays the same.</p>

    <h2><u>Section 4</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What happens to the top L?</h3>

    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned that computers use Logic Composistion to communicate.</p>

    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when making the logic composations for myself.</p>

    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?></u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by studying logic composistions a bit more.</p>

    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that everything is technically communicated to with logic composistion.</p>
