    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned that computers use Logic Composistion to communicate.</p>

    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when making the logic composations for myself.</p>

    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?></u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by studying logic composistions a bit more.</p>

    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that everything is technically communicated to with logic composistion.</p>
