    <h1>CS-I Journal J1013: Boolean Algebra</h1>
    <p>Name: Anish Choudhury</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mrs. Jang</p>
    <p>I assisted: NO ONE</p>

    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction?</h3>
    <p>To show that A and B are both true and both are not true.</p>

    <h2><u>Section 2</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</h3>
    <p>It acts like a function. You can't get an output without the input. 2^n is used to find out the number of rows in any such table.</p>

    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned that how to do boolean expressions.</p>

    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I came across 2^n.</p>

    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by clearer instructions in coder merlin.</p>

    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that computers use boolean expressions to think.</p>
