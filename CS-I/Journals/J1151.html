    <h1>CS-I Journal J1151: Conditional and Flow Chart</h1>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mrs. Jang</p> 
    <p>I assisted: NO ONE</p>
	 
    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <p>1.1: Branching enables significantly more complex program behavior because it creates boolean expressions which can be simplified effieciently by the computer.</p>
    <p>1.2: The term Consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed with the Boolean test evaluates to true because Consequents definition is "following as a result or effect".</p>

    <h2><u>Section 2</u></h2>
    <p>2.1: The first jump condition is conditional because it determines whether the instruction execution will happen or not. It is determined by instructions.</p>
    <p>2.2: The purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent is to determine if the CPU can skip any other intervening instructions.</p>
    <p>2.3: Because there are no other instructions to meet after going to the alternative.</p>
    
    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned about Flow Charts and their terms.</p>
    
    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when learning about Consequents and Alternatives.</p>
    
    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by studying the wiki some more.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that instructions are all followed with flow charts.</p>
