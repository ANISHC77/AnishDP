    <h2><u>Section 1</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model</h3>
    <p>Discord and Youtube</p>
    <h2><u>Section 2</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I think it is important because having two users using one directory would be chaos. One would be changing the other person's code and the other person wouldn’t know.</p>
    <h2><u>Section 3</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why do you think the ime directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
    <p>I think that the home directory is the most important directory because it is the 'home' for all the other directories.</p>
    <h2><u>Section 4</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
    <p>The prompt changed. It added 'Merlin' to my directory response. This is useful because know I can know where I am in the humongous directory.</p>
    <h2><u>Section 5</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What happens each time when you press the up arrow?</h3>
    <p>When I press the up arrow, it repeats the last command I typed.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What happens each time when you press the down arrow?</h3>
    <p>When I press the down arrow, it removes the command that came from the up arrow.</p>
    <h2><u>Section 6</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p>I think the “Hello, World” was redirected to another location named out.txt</p>
    <h2><u>Section 7</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
    <p>The tree command shows us a digram to where we are meanwhile, the ls command just shows what directory you're in.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
    <p>Tree if you are genuinely confused about where you are meanwhile, ls to quickly remember where you are.</p>
    <h2><u>Section 8</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
    <p>The argument is the number of seconds your second line goes blank.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Are you able to prove your hypthesis? How?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I am able to prove my hypothesis by actually experimenting with the shell.</p>
    <h2><u>Section 9</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
    <p>This is different to what I expected because it’s running in the background.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p>I am not sure yet but, I will continue to experiment.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
    <p>I also don’t know about this one. I need to figure it out.</p>
    <h2><u>Section 10</u></h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command</h3>
    <p>It shows the jobs running in the background.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: How do you explain your observations?</h3>
    <p>For example, [2]- Done     Sleep 60</p>

    <h2><u>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</u></h2>
    <p>I learned how to navigate through the shell.</p>

    <h2><u>What challenges did I encounter?</u></h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I tried Section 7</u></p>

    <h2><u>How could this experience be improved?</u></h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by studying</p>

    <h2><u>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</u></h2>
    <p>I now realize that you need to study to succeed.</p>
