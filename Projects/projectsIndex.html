          <h3>AHS Map Internship</h3>
          <p>In this internship, I teamed up with two of my friends to create a navigational app for the purpose to help students navigate a 150+ acre high school campus. As soon as we finish the app for Allen High School, we plan to release this app to other schools for a profit.</p>

          <h3>NASA Hunch 2024</h3>
          <p>In Nasa HUNCH 2024, me and my team made it to the National Finalist level. The main purpose of this project was to implement an effective control system that can change certain parts of the environment in a lunar base or home by using a manually controlled sensor.</p>

          <h3>Smart Mirror Project</h3>
          <p>I co-created this project with my friend as a fun summer project. The smart mirror displays different information about the day, such as the weather, time, and important events. Seeing the smart mirror everyday as soon as I wake up is nice! I can see what's going on.</p>
