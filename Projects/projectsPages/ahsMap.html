    <h1>AHS Map / Edupath | Internship</h1>
    <h2>I teamed up with my friends, Jayadeep Velagapudi and Rishi Nigam, to construct a navigational dedicated to help relieve students' tensions when navigating big schools.</h2>
    <h3>We first noticed the problem as juniors when attempting to get to our classes. The hallways were packed with traffic. Our high school, being the biggest high school in Texas, decided to attempt to alleviate traffic by creating this app. Right now, we are almost done with our prototype. We are currently working under ALLEN ISD with unpaid-internships.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>The app has many features. Currently, we have a home page, map page, and settings page. In the home page, it displays your current schedule, along with a button that automatically navigates you to your next classroom. The map page is the map feature of the app. While it uses Apple's and Android's API for maps, it does not actually use their features. It only uses the background. The navigational part of the map page itself was coded by us using A* search. Our last page, the settings page, has features that can edit the map and app itself.</h3>
