    <h1>Smart Mirror Project</h1>
    <h2>My and my friend, Jason Siv, created this smart mirror as a fun summer project. We were met with many challenges. For example, in our first attempt, we had messed up and destroyed a componenet. However, we perservered and continued with a replaced componenet.</h2>
    <h3>The smart mirror has a lot of features that make it cool! For example, the smart mirror uses a weather-base's API and recieves data about the weather and displays it on the mirror. The mirror also uses the NYtimes API to do the same thing, but for the news. Along with the news and weather, it also uses Spotify's API to display the music you are currently playing on your Spotify account!</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>The software side of the mirror was created using react-native and a library on github. Regarding the hardware, the mirror uses a raspberry pi and an Acer monitor. </h3>
